# Introduction

The Heddoko API follows a [RESTful design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). This means that each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (or URI) and is manipulated through regular HTTP verbs such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE`.
