Data structures 

Stretch Sensors 

|-|StretchContainer (the body container for all stretch joints)
|---|mStretchJoints (list of StretchJoints)  
|------|mCurJointRotationEuler (Vector = 3 floats => Calculated from the combination of StretchSensor values) 
|------|mStretchSensors (list of StretchSensors)
|---------|mCSValues (List of Int32 values, each entry is a sensor reading. The sensors reading frequency is higher than the frame rate)


Nod Sensors

|-|NodContainer (the body container for all nod joints)
|---|mNodJoints (list of NodJoints)  
|------|inverseInitRotation (Quaternion = 4 floats => Calculated from the first reading of the nod sensor) 
|------|mNodSensors (list of NodSensors)
|---------|initRotation (Quaternion = 4 floats => Calculated from the first reading of the nod sensor) 
|---------|curRotation (Quaternion = 4 floats => quaternion readings from sensors) 
|---------|curRotationRawEuler (Vector = 4 floats => Raw euler angles readings from sensors, used to do the mapping to bones orientations)
